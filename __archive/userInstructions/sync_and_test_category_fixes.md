# Testing Category Management Fixes

This document provides instructions for testing the fixes made to the category management functionality in the moving box tracker application.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed error message handling for duplicate categories**:
   - Updated the frontend code to properly detect and display error messages when attempting to add or edit a category with a name that already exists
   - Changed error handling in network error cases to provide more accurate messages

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Sync the Changes

First, sync these changes to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# On your development machine
git add templates/categories.html
git commit -m "Fix error message handling for duplicate categories"
git push

# On your Raspberry Pi
cd /path/to/your/repository
git pull
```

### 2. Restart the Application

```bash
# On your Raspberry Pi
sudo systemctl restart moving-app.service
# Or however you normally restart the application
```

### 3. Test Adding a Duplicate Category

1. Open your browser and navigate to the category management page
2. Try to add a category with a name that already exists
3. Verify that you see the error message: "Error category already exists!: Not adding"

### 4. Test Editing a Category to a Duplicate Name

1. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to any existing category
2. In the edit modal, change the name to match another existing category
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Verify that you see the error message: "Error category already exists!: Not adding"

### 5. Test Network Error Handling (Optional)

If you want to test the network error handling:
1. Temporarily disconnect your device from the network
2. Try to add or edit a category
3. Verify that you see the error message: "Error: Network or server issue. Please try again."

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Clear browser cache**: The browser might be caching old JavaScript files
   ```
   Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R to force refresh
   ```

2. **Check browser console**: Open developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect) and check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors

3. **Check server logs**: Look for any errors in the application logs
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u moving-app.service -f
   # Or check your application's log files
   ```

4. **Verify database consistency**: Run the fix_box_categories.py script if you haven't already
   ```bash
   python fix_box_categories.py
   ```

## Feedback
