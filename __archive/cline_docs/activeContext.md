## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (Successfully Migrated)
```sql
-- New schema (implemented):
boxes: id, box_number, priority, category_id (FK), box_size, description, created_at, last_modified, is_deleted
categories: id, name, created_at, is_active

-- Old schema (deprecated):
boxes: category (text field) -> replaced with category_id foreign key
```

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Dynamic Category Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete categories
   - Usage-based deletion protection
   - Real-time category statistics

2. **Enhanced Box Creation**
   - Dropdown populated from database
   - Quick category addition modal
   - Automatic category creation on-the-fly

3. **Mobile-Optimized Interface**
   - Large touch targets (44px minimum)
   - Responsive Bootstrap design
   - AJAX for smooth interactions

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Soft deletes for categories
   - Usage counting and validation

## Current Issue: Environment Setup
- Flask dependency not found in current Python environment
- Affects both original and fixed applications
- **Solution needed**: Activate proper conda environment or install dependencies
- **Code is complete and ready** - just needs proper environment

## Deployment Ready Checklist
- ✅ All code written and tested for syntax
- ✅ Feature branch commits complete
- ✅ UI templates created and optimized
- ✅ Database compatibility ensured
- ⏳ Environment setup for testing
- ⏳ Final integration testing
- ⏳ Merge to main branch

## Next Steps for User
1. **Resolve Environment**: Get Flask working in conda environment
