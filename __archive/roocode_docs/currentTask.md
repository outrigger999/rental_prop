# Current Task

## Objective
- Fix issues with category management in the moving box tracker application
- Specifically address:
  1. Case-insensitive duplicate category prevention
  2. Display issues where categories show as "none" in the box list view
  3. Improve error messages for duplicate categories

## Context
- The application was experiencing issues with category management:
  - Duplicate categories were being created despite case-insensitive checks
  - Categories were displaying as "none" in the box list view
  - Error messages for duplicate categories weren't showing correctly in the UI

## Next Steps
- [x] Update frontend code in templates/categories.html to properly handle error messages for duplicate categories
  - Modified error detection to use `includes('already exists')` instead of exact string matching
  - Updated error messages in catch blocks to be more descriptive
- [x] Create userInstructions/sync_and_test_category_fixes.md with detailed testing instructions
- [ ] Update projectRoadmap.md to include category management fixes
- [ ] Test the changes on the Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Verify that duplicate categories are properly prevented
- [ ] Verify that categories display correctly in the box list view
- [ ] Verify that error messages display correctly when attempting to add duplicate categories
