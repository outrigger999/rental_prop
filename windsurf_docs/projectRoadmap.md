# Rental Property Tracker - Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals

### Primary Objective
Create a personal web application for efficiently tracking and managing rental properties during a property search, focusing on key criteria and commute times in the Seattle area.

### Key Features to Implement
- [x] **Phase 1 MVP (Completed)**
  - [x] Basic property data entry system
  - [x] SQLite database integration
  - [x] Flask web interface foundation
  - [x] Fix browser accessibility issues on Raspberry Pi
  - [x] Implement proper Git-based deployment workflow
  - [x] Complete basic property listing and viewing functionality

- [x] **Phase 2 Growth Features (Completed)**
  - [ ] Image upload and display for properties (Front, Back, Parking, Satellite, Route)
  - [x] Peak traffic driving distance input with visual support
  - [ ] Google Maps integration for route images
  - [x] Search and filter functionality
  - [ ] Edit and delete property functionality
  - [x] Data export and backup functionality

- [ ] **Phase 3 Scale Features**
  - [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
  - [ ] Performance optimizations

## Completion Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] Application successfully deployed and accessible on Raspberry Pi 4
- [ ] Users can add new properties with all specified fields
- [ ] Property data is persistently stored and retrievable
- [ ] Basic property list view is functional
- [ ] Sync-to-Pi workflow is reliable and automated

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All code changes committed to Git with proper branching strategy
- [ ] Deployment via Git pull on Raspberry Pi (no direct file sync)
- [ ] Application accessible via browser from other devices on network
- [ ] Database and uploads properly synchronized between development and production

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Read and analyze all 7 JSON project context files
- [x] Understand project architecture and requirements
- [x] Identify current deployment and accessibility issues

## Progress Tracker
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 MVP  
**Current Version:** 0.1.0-alpha  
**Status:** Troubleshooting deployment and accessibility issues

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Database migration strategy for schema changes
- Image storage optimization for Raspberry Pi performance
- Potential multi-user support architecture
