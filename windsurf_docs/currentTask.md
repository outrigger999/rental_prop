# Current Task - Rental Property Tracker

## Current Objectives
Implement core rental tracker features and document the application for users.

## Context
The application has been developed as a Flask-based web app for tracking rental properties. The initial deployment and accessibility issues have been resolved, and the app is now accessible via browser from other devices on the network. The core rental tracker features have been implemented, including property creation, listing, searching, and data export functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Deployment and Accessibility Issues
- ✅ Fixed sync script by replacing with working version from `__archive`
- ✅ Updated app.py to bind to 0.0.0.0 on port 6000
- ✅ Implemented proper Git-based deployment workflow
- ✅ Verified browser access at http://192.168.10.10:6000 and http://rental.box

### 2. Core Feature Implementation
- ✅ Create New Rental page with all specified fields
- ✅ List Rentals page showing all properties
- ✅ Search Rentals functionality with multiple filter options
- ✅ Export and Backup features (CSV and JSON formats)
- ✅ User documentation created

## Current Focus - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Git Workflow Resolution ✅
- ✅ Resolved deployment reverting to old version issue
- ✅ Established Git-first deployment workflow
- ✅ Fixed SSH authentication issues in sync script
- ✅ Updated sync script to use correct database names and paths

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation Creation ✅
- ✅ Updated project_template_guide.md with all lessons learned
- ✅ Enhanced improved_sync_strategies.md with Git-first workflow
- ✅ Documented SSH configuration requirements
- ✅ Created troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Completed Tasks - All Major Issues Resolved

### 1. SSH Authentication Issues ✅
- Fixed sync script to use `movingdb` SSH host alias
- Eliminated username@hostname authentication problems
- Documented proper SSH configuration for future projects

### 2. Git Workflow Implementation ✅
- Committed all latest code changes to GitHub
- Established mandatory commit-before-deploy workflow
- Verified Pi pulls latest code from Git repository
- Eliminated code version mismatch issues

### 3. Deployment Success ✅
- Application successfully deployed with all features
- All updates (image upload, search, export) now working on Pi
- Automatic permission handling prevents 403 errors
- Service running correctly on Pi

## Next Steps - Project Template Creation

1. **Complete windsurf_docs updates** - Finish updating remaining documentation files
2. **Create project templates** - Ensure all lessons learned are captured for future projects
3. **Verify template completeness** - Test that templates prevent all encountered issues
4. **Document success criteria** - Define what constitutes successful project cloning
