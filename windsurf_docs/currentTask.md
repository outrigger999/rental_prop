# Current Task - Rental Property Tracker

## Current Objectives
Implement core rental tracker features and document the application for users.

## Context
The application has been developed as a Flask-based web app for tracking rental properties. The initial deployment and accessibility issues have been resolved, and the app is now accessible via browser from other devices on the network. The core rental tracker features have been implemented, including property creation, listing, searching, and data export functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Deployment and Accessibility Issues
- ✅ Fixed sync script by replacing with working version from `__archive`
- ✅ Updated app.py to bind to 0.0.0.0 on port 6000
- ✅ Implemented proper Git-based deployment workflow
- ✅ Verified browser access at http://192.168.10.10:6000 and http://rental.box

### 2. Core Feature Implementation
- ✅ Create New Rental page with all specified fields
- ✅ List Rentals page showing all properties
- ✅ Search Rentals functionality with multiple filter options
- ✅ Export and Backup features (CSV and JSON formats)
- ✅ User documentation created

## Current Focus

### 1. Testing and Refinement
- Ensure all implemented features work correctly on the Pi
- Test search functionality with various filter combinations
- Verify export functionality for both CSV and JSON formats

### 2. Documentation
- Complete user documentation for all features
- Update technical documentation in windsurf_docs

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy latest changes** - Run sync_to_pi.sh from Mac to deploy to Pi
2. **Test on Pi** - SSH to movingdb, activate rental_prop_env, test all features
3. **Gather user feedback** - Identify any usability issues or desired improvements
4. **Plan Phase 3 features** - Prepare for advanced features implementation
